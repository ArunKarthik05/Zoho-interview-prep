### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Explanation:**
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Customers rent virtual machines, storage, and networks and manage them as needed.

**Example: Zoho Cloud**

**Real-Time Example:**
A growing e-commerce company needs scalable storage and computing power to handle its increasing customer base and transactions. Instead of investing in physical servers, they use Zoho Cloud services to rent virtual machines and storage space. The company has control over the operating systems and applications they install on these virtual machines, while Zoho manages the underlying hardware and infrastructure.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Explanation:**
PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. This includes development tools, databases, and application hosting.

**Example: Zoho Creator**

**Real-Time Example:**
A small business wants to create a custom application to manage their inventory and sales processes. They use Zoho Creator, a low-code application development platform. With Zoho Creator, they can quickly build, deploy, and manage their application without worrying about server management or scalability issues. The platform provides all necessary tools and services to develop and run the application efficiently.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Explanation:**
SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access the software via a web browser, and the provider manages the infrastructure, software updates, and security.

**Example: Zoho CRM**

**Real-Time Example:**
A sales team uses Zoho CRM to manage customer relationships, track leads, and automate sales processes. They access Zoho CRM through their web browsers, and all data is stored in the cloud. Zoho handles all software updates, security patches, and infrastructure management. The sales team focuses on their work without needing to worry about the underlying technology, paying a subscription fee for the service.
