### Point-to-Point Messaging

**What It Is:**
- Point-to-Point (P2P) Messaging is a system where messages are sent from one producer to one specific consumer through a queue.

**How It Works:**
1. **Producer:** Sends a message to a queue.
2. **Queue:** Stores the message temporarily.
3. **Consumer:** Retrieves and processes the message from the queue.

**Key Points:**
- Each message is delivered to only one consumer.
- After the message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
- This model ensures that messages are handled by one and only one consumer.

**Example:**
- Imagine a ticket booking system where users (producers) send booking requests (messages) to a queue. Each request is then handled by a single server (consumer) that processes it and updates the booking status.

### Publish-Subscribe Messaging

**What It Is:**
- Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Messaging is a system where messages are sent to multiple consumers that are interested in receiving them, based on subscription to certain topics or channels.

**How It Works:**
1. **Producer:** Publishes a message to a topic or channel.
2. **Topic/Channel:** A categorization mechanism that holds messages.
3. **Consumers:** Subscribe to specific topics or channels to receive messages published to those topics.

**Key Points:**
- Messages can be delivered to multiple consumers who are subscribed to the topic.
- Each message published to a topic is received by all consumers subscribed to that topic.
- This model is useful when multiple consumers need to process the same message.

**Example:**
- Imagine a news system where articles (messages) are published under different categories (topics) like sports, technology, and entertainment. Subscribers (consumers) interested in sports receive all sports-related articles.
