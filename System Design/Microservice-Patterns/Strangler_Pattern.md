The Strangler Pattern is a design pattern used for gradually migrating a legacy system to a new system by incrementally replacing parts of the legacy functionality with new microservices. This pattern ensures that the system remains functional throughout the migration process, minimizing risks and avoiding the need for a complete rewrite. The name "Strangler" is inspired by the strangler fig tree, which grows around an existing tree and eventually replaces it.

### Key Concepts of the Strangler Pattern

1. **Incremental Migration**:
   - Instead of rewriting the entire system from scratch, the migration is done incrementally by replacing small parts of the legacy system with new services.

2. **Parallel Running**:
   - Both the legacy system and the new system run in parallel. As more functionality is migrated to the new system, the dependency on the legacy system decreases.

3. **Routing and Interception**:
   - A fa√ßade or intermediary layer intercepts requests to the legacy system and routes them to either the legacy system or the new system based on the current state of the migration.
#### Scenario:
You have a monolithic e-commerce application that you want to migrate to a microservices-based architecture. The legacy system handles user authentication, product catalog, orders, and payments.

#### Steps:

1. **Identify Components for Migration**:
   - Start with a non-critical component like the product catalog.

2. **Create a Routing Layer**:
   - Implement an API Gateway or a proxy that intercepts requests to the product catalog.

3. **Develop New Services**:
   - Develop a new microservice for the product catalog with a modern tech stack.

4. **Route Requests to New Services**:
   - Update the API Gateway to route product catalog requests to the new microservice.
   - Continue serving other functionalities (authentication, orders, payments) from the legacy system.

5. **Decommission Legacy Components**:
   - Once the product catalog microservice is fully functional and tested, remove the corresponding functionality from the legacy system.
   - Proceed with the next component, such as user authentication, and repeat the process.

### Benefits of the Strangler Pattern

1. **Reduced Risk**:
   - By migrating incrementally, the risk of introducing critical failures is minimized compared to a complete system rewrite.

2. **Continuous Functionality**:
   - The system remains functional throughout the migration process, ensuring uninterrupted service to users.

3. **Incremental Improvement**:
   - Allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, enabling the integration of modern technologies and practices over time.

4. **Easier Troubleshooting**:
   - Problems can be isolated to smaller parts of the system, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues during migration.

### Challenges

1. **Complex Routing Logic**:
   - Implementing and maintaining the routing layer can become complex as the number of migrated components increases.

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Ensuring data consistency and synchronization between the legacy system and new services can be challenging.

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Temporary solutions and workarounds may introduce technical debt that needs to be addressed as the migration progresses.
